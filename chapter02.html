    <h1 class=section-title>Calculating fractal dimensions</h1>
    <h2 class=sub-section-title>What is a fractal?</h2>
    Fractals are objects that have a "dimension" strictly greater than the topological dimension. This is only one definition of a fractal, but it is usualy a very convenient definition. Of course it leave us clueless if we do not know what the dimension of an object is supposed to be.
    It turns out that it is somewhat difficult to give a mathematical definition of the simple concept of dimension. But basically one can give a number called  <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_dimension">topological dimension</a></em> to each set of points of $\mathbb R^n$. And it behaves as it should for all standard figures. A line has topological dimension 1, a circle 2, a cube 3, and so on. One can give a numbre to every set. But is this number the dimension?

   There are many others definions of what a dimension should be. One of the most famous one is called the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension">Hausdorffâ€“Besicovitch dimension</a></em>. It is extremely intuitive. Lets be formal.
   <div>Definition</div>

   Let $M \in \mathbb R^n$ a subset. Now take any real number $d\in [0,n]$ and cover the set $M$ by balls, so that $M\in\sum_{i\in I}B_i$. Imagine that the radius of the ball $B_i$ is $r_i$. Now consider the number
   \begin{equation}
   C^d(M) = \textrm{inf}\left\{\sum_{i\in I} r_i^d\right\}
   \end{equation}
   The Hausdorff dimension is defined by
   \begin{gather}
   \textrm{dim}_H(M) = \textrm{inf}\{d\geq 0 : C^d(M) = 0\}
   \end{gather}
