    <h1 class=section-title>Introduction: <br />What is Clouds Analyzer?</h1>
    <p>Coulds Analyzer is a computer program written by Sandra Ocando and Nicolás Hatcher during 2008. Our initial task was to make a series of Fortran algorithms to study images of interstellar molecular clouds. Very soon we realized that the problem of calculating fractal dimension were far from trivial and a less abstract and more concrete aproach was needed to undertand how the different algorithims to meassure fractal dimensions work. Eventually, and thanks to the easy of use of the Qt4 libraries, the program evolved into a whole graphical application. Once the program was finished we understood that it was very likely that different people would want to use the program for their own means. So we started thinking in making a public release. Sandra got engaged into far more interesting things and pursued a phD, and I got stuck into far more boring stuff (computer programming)</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, for the last two years there has not been a month in which I have not looked at the program and said to myself "What a wonderfull word of fractals!".</p>
    <p>Well, this is me trying to do something about it. Let's see how far can we go.</p>
    <p>Clouds Analyzer is a program that does three things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Analyze some fractal properties of existing images </li>
      <li> Generate some fractals </li>
      <li> Manipulate some images </li>
    </ol>
    The two important properties of fractals (images) that the program studies are:
    <ol>
      <li> Fractal dimensions </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Box-counting dimensions</li>
        <li>Area-perimeter dimensions</li>
        <li>Rengi dimensions</li>
        <li>Correlation dimensions</li>
      </ul>
      <li> Tecniques of spatial metric</li>
    </ol>
    The fractals that the program generate are:
    <ol>
      <li> Koch curves </li>
      <li> Fractional Brownian movement in 1, 2 and 3D </li>
      <li> Hénon atractor </li>
    </ol>
